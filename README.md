- Scientific computing applications  


## üöÄ Main CUDA Source Codes

The following are the primary CUDA source files in this project:

| File Name        | Description                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------|
| `ALFG_Multi.cu`  | Multi-threaded ALFG logic   |
| `ALFG_Single.cu` | Single-threaded ALFG logic  |

> üìù These files implement GPU-based algorithms for high-performance number generation and simulation.


Usage:

## üß™ Compile and Run CUDA Program (`ALFG_Multi.cu`)

### Step 1: Compile with `nvcc`

```bash
nvcc -o ALFG_Multi ALFG_Multi.cu
```
### Step 2: Run the Executable
```
./ALFG_Multi

You can compile and run the *.cu files in the same manner.

# üîç Comparison of CUDA-Based Pseudorandom Number Generators

This project implements three distinct pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) using NVIDIA CUDA:

- **ALFG_Single.cu**: Single-threaded Additive Lagged Fibonacci Generator
- **ALFG_Multi.cu**: Multi-threaded Additive Lagged Fibonacci Generator
- **GFSR.cu**: Generalized Feedback Shift Register Generator

Each implementation showcases different strategies for parallelization and performance optimization on GPU architectures.

## üßµ `ALFG_Single.cu`: Single-Threaded Execution

- **Execution Model**: Utilizes a single GPU thread to generate the entire sequence of random numbers.
- **Implementation**:
  - The kernel function is launched with a single thread.
  - A loop within the kernel computes the ALFG sequence serially.
  - The generated numbers are stored in global memory.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for testing, debugging, or scenarios where parallelization overhead outweighs performance gains.

## üåê `ALFG_Multi.cu`: Multi-Threaded Parallel Execution

- **Execution Model**: Leverages multiple GPU threads to generate random numbers in parallel.
- **Implementation**:
  - The kernel function is launched with multiple threads, each responsible for computing a portion of the ALFG sequence.
  - Each thread calculates its indices based on thread and block IDs to avoid overlap.
  - Synchronization mechanisms are used when necessary.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for high-performance applications requiring large volumes of random numbers (e.g., Monte Carlo simulations).

## üîÅ `GFSR.cu`: Generalized Feedback Shift Register Implementation

- **Execution Model**: Employs parallel GPU threads to implement the GFSR pseudorandom number algorithm.
- **Implementation**:
  - Each thread computes a segment of the sequence using feedback from previous values.
  - The GFSR algorithm uses XOR operations and lagged feedback shifts.
  - Threads operate independently to maximize throughput.
- **Use Case**: Well-suited for fast, high-quality random number generation in massively parallel settings.
